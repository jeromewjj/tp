### Project: NetworkUS

NetworkUS is a desktop app for organizing contacts. It features seamless **group management**, allowing for **quick searches of contacts with desired traits** (i.e specialization) and hence **project group formation**. It is catered for **Computer Science Students** with fields such as Github and Linkedin.
The app is optimized for the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** to allow swift access for keyboard users. The app is also complemented with **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to display the program.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to remove tag from persons more effectively.
    * What it does: allows the user to untag specified tag from multiple persons directly simultaneously.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows user to remove tags easily.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to replace tag from persons more effectively.
    * What it does: allows the user to replace specified tag from persons to a new tag
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows user to update the tags easily.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.


* **Enhancements to existing features**: Modified Person to allow empty field.
  * What it does: provide user the options to not add fields they do not want 
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it provides flexibility to the user to add only necessary information.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was difficult as it required changes to existing commands.
